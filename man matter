                <h3>Men Matter Story</h3>
                <p>"Girls and boys see gender inequality in their homes and communities every day – in textbooks, in the media and among the adults who care for them.

                    Parents may assume unequal responsibility for household work, with mothers bearing the brunt of caregiving and chores. The majority of low-skilled and underpaid community health workers who attend to children are also women, with limited opportunity for professional growth.
                    
                    And in schools, many girls receive less support than boys to pursue the studies they choose. This happens for a variety of reasons: The safety, hygiene and sanitation needs of girls may be neglected, barring them from regularly attending class. Discriminatory teaching practices and education materials also produce gender gaps in learning and skills development. As a result, nearly 1 in 4 girls between the ages of 15 and 19 are neither employed nor in education or training – compared to 1 in 10 boys."</p>

            <h3>Men’s Dialogues As A Tool In The Fight Against GBV And HIV In Lesotho</h3>
            <p>In the beginning of 2023 two organizations partnered with male leaders in Lesotho to initiate men’s dialogues to discuss and find solutions to the factors that drive violence against women and girls and HIV infections in the Southern African nation.

            <p>2023 has been a pivotal year for HeForShe, marking significant strides in the global movement for gender equality. In the face of pushback against women’s rights and intersecting challenges from climate change to anti-gender movements, HeForShe has continued to build a solidarity movement of men and boys who stand alongside women and girls in all their diversity in the pursuit of a better, gender equal world for everyone. As we embark on a new year with renewed commitment, let's reflect on the milestones achieved by HeForShe throughout 2023.</p>
